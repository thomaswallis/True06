# True06
This project is attempting to be as accurate to 2006 version of RuneScape.

Myself and many others are unhappy with the current state of OldSchool Runescape and RS3 and this aims to fix this.

At first this will be a solo project but I am open to one day making this opensource and also potentially getting a couple people on the project working but this will be somewhat more risky as it could mess up with the main game.

My current resources for accurate information are:
RuneHQ using the wayback machine at the end of December 2006
YouTube videos such as quest guides from 2006
When I can't find information on something I will default to the OSRS method/facts
